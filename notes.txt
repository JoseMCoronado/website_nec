Can not make changes to 'Customer Information' (Billing Information) form in Odoo online (not worth an ugly hack). Therefore,
will not be able to make all fields required & add an industry field.

Questions:
Will entering the same customer information on a second visit create another customer record?
It will not create a new customer, if the user is logged in, they will edit their customer information. Only when
someone is not logged in will it create a customer.
