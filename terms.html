Any provision, term or condition contained in Purchaser’s order or confirmation form which are inconsistent with these Terms and Conditions shall not be binding on Seller, and shall not be considered applicable to the sale, shipment or use of the Equipment. No modification of, addition to or waiver of any of these Terms and Conditions will be effective unless agreed to in writing by an authorized signatory on behalf of Seller, and in no event shall such modification, addition or waiver affect any rights of Seller accruing prior thereto.

Seller may adjust the price and extend the date for shipment for a reasonable time, based upon the length of the delay, the extent of the change and the conditions then existing at Seller’s factory. Seller may also, at its option, invoice Purchaser for work already performed on its order, or for equipment then ready for shipment, and payment therefor shall be made within twenty (20) days of notification and request for payment.

If within a reasonable period of time Seller is unable to correct the Defect specified in the claim and has given Purchaser written notice to that effect, Purchaser’s sole and exclusive remedy will be to return to Seller said defective Equipment, or that part thereof referred to in the claim, upon Seller’s prior written authorization, and Seller, at its option, shall refund to Purchaser the purchase price of such defective Equipment, or part thereof returned, or replace same.
